# Description

This repositroy consists of two projects given as final projects for "Sensor Systems" at Singidunum University. The projects are:

1. Arduino project where the task was to read data from an ultrasonic sensor and control motor speed. This speed is then measured using an optical encoder and print out on the serial port.
2. Python project where the tast was to load an image and create the following filters: Grayscale, Gaussian Blur and graphs: Histogram, Cumulative Distribution Function.
